Deep Learning in  Network  monitoring ( கண்காணிப்பு )  

 The Internet is designed to carry data by using IP packets across the network and deliver,  as per destination given its header segment. Challenge is to monitor above mentioned IP packets in a given enterprise  network and permit the same IP packet to travel to a defined destination mahine. IP packets have few variations such as TCP, UDP and ICMP.  Moreover, mentioned IP packets need  to use PORTs in a given Machine to deliver.  There have been events in which unwanted and harmful IP packets are used  to perform certain act in a remote machine.  Thus, there is a need to stop such IP packets in a given enterprise network and provide safety  to users of the internet in their enterprise. Volume of IP packets travels in a given enterprise network requires a huge amount of computing power to monitor IP packets and safeguard their user application.  

 Autonomous monitoring systems require “capturing IP packets “ in neal time and infer safety level of enterprise network,  Digital Assistant with AI provides a method to monitor a given enterprise IP network.

Above mentioned Assistant is designed to have conversations with Human user.  To have effective and efficient conversion, a design is expected to include “ Intents”  that are very useful for Assistant to narrow down questions and synthesise answers in a given time frame.  “Entities “ expected to helpAssistant to understand conversion from Human at other end.  For example, Port can be intent and entities can be Port is blocked, Port is opened etc. Essentially, there can be manu entities have association with one Intent.   Dialog is useful part for Human being to have conversation with a given Assistant and find out information from Network Monitoring Task.  





Packet sniffing provides IP packets for analysis.  Often, mentioned analysis is expected to happen in near real time.   IBM Watson Assistant provides provides tool set to design “கண்காணிப்பு Monitoring  Assistant”, in short period of time and deploy it in cloud or in on-premise infra structure.
